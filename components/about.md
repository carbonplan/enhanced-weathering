The goal of this tool is to support broad community engagement around enhanced weathering monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV). To do so, we catalog quantitative methods that may be used to estimate net carbon removal from enhanced weathering. In the context of this tool, we focus on enhanced weathering that is performed by spreading ground rock on agricultural soils.

CarbonPlan collaborated with Iris Holzer (University of California, Santa Barbara), Noah Sokol (Lawrence Livermore National Lab), and Eric Slessarev (Yale University) to build this tool. Contributions from all authors were made in their personal capacity under contract with CarbonPlan. CarbonPlan received [no specific financial support](https://carbonplan.org/funding) for this work.

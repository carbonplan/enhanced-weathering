Therefore, alkalinity measurements are context-dependent and do not necessarily represent lasting outcomes. Continuous monitoring of total alkalinity (TA) would be required to capture the total flux of additional bicarbonate as a result of enhanced weathering. However, this poses a challenge given realistic sampling constraints and equipment interference with farming operations. Care must be taken that other field management changes are not responsible for observed shifts in alkalinity (e.g., changing irrigation source or rate), which emphasizes the importance of establishing a dynamic baseline rather than solely monitoring alkalinity prior to rock application. Alkalinity may also be estimated by measuring cations (see ""Cations / anions"") or potentially by monitoring electrical conductivity as a proxy (see ""Electrical conductivity"").

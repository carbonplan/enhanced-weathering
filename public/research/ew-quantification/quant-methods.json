Care must be taken that other field management changes are not responsible for observed shifts in DIC (e.g., changing irrigation source or rate), which emphasizes the importance of establishing a dynamic baseline rather than solely monitoring DIC prior to rock application. Note that there may be a delay between initial weathering and a DIC signal as a result of interactions between weathered cations and the soil exchange complex (see \"Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchange complex cations\").

Because silicate weathering is a proton-consuming reaction, an increase in pH is expected and could signal that weathering has occured. The magnitude of this change depends on the weathering rate, the starting pH of the system, and the buffering capacity of the soil. Increasing pH may cause wide-ranging impacts, from altering nutrient availability and trace metal mobility (positively or negatively) to reducing N\u2082O emissions or shifting management practices. Monitoring pH also provides important information for constraining carbon removal \u2014 for example, as an environmental factor that determines carbonate speciation and therefore the relationship between cations released by weathering and bicarbonate formation. pH is a routine soil measurement and may be measured on soil or water samples collected for other purposes.",

For example, changes in system pH as a result of enhanced weathering might also shift the mobilization and bioavailability of potentially toxic trace metals in the environment.

      "comments": "Bicarbonate alkalinity is subject to fluctuations as pH and other system parameters change, altering carbonate speciation. Therefore, alkalinity measurements are context-dependent and do not necessarily represent lasting outcomes. Continuous monitoring of total alkalinity (TA) would be required to capture the total flux of additional bicarbonate as a result of enhanced weathering. However, this poses a challenge given realistic sampling constraints and equipment interference with farming operations. Care must be taken that other field management changes are not responsible for observed shifts in alkalinity (e.g., changing irrigation source or rate), which emphasizes the importance of establishing a dynamic baseline rather than solely monitoring alkalinity prior to rock application. Alkalinity may also be estimated by measuring cations (see \"Cations / anions\") or potentially by monitoring electrical conductivity as a proxy (see \"Electrical conductivity\").  Note that there may be a delay between initial weathering and a total alkalinity signal as a result of interactions between weathered cations and the soil exchange complex (see \"Cation exchange complex (CEC) and exchange complex cations\").",

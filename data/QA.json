      "comments": "Measuring cations can also provide the basis for estimating total alkalinity; however, in contrast to measuring alkalinity or DIC, the cations associated with rock weathering (e.g. Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+) are conserved and not subject to the same dynamic shifts as carbonate species, for example. The additional flux of ions as a result of enhanced weathering is a continuous process and can be highly variable over time. As a result, there are major challenges associated with taking intermittent measurements and trying to integrate them to characterize overall ion flux. In the absence of a rigorously constructed baseline, isolating the effects of rock weathering on ion fluxes may be difficult.",

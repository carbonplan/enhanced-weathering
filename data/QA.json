As a result, there are major challenges associated with taking intermittent measurements and trying to integrate them to characterize overall ion flux.

      "notes": "Changes in yield due to rock application are possible and are generally presumed to be positive, for example by increasing the availability of additional micronutrients or increasing pH. These effects could also potentially be neutral or negative, for example via pH changes that negatively impact nutrient availability. Yield may be determined from farm records of industrial-scale harvesting or using smaller-scale hand harvest approaches.",
      "comments": "Yield impacts are less likely if rock composition is relatively benign (see \"elemental composition\"), the soil is relatively fertile to begin with, and no changes to fertilizer regime are made (see \"field management\"). Tracking yield changes may not be necessary if a clear positive or neutral relationship is established for a given weathering material, soil type, and crop type.",
